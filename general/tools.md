### Tools

We strongly believe that the choice of tools is important to get the work done efficiently. However, every person has
her/his own favorite tools. We do not want to force people to use specific tools, we just expect that everybody picks
the right tools to be as effective as possible.

Here is a list of tools which are used at Robotic Eyes:
